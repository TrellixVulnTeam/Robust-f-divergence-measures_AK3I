# When Optimizing f-Divergence is Robust with Label noise

This repository is the official Pytorch implementation of "[When Optimizing f-Divergence is Robust with Label noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03687)" accepted by ICLR2021. 


## Required Packages & Environment
**Supported OS:** Windows, Linux, Mac OS X; Python: 3.6/3.7; 

**Deep Learning Library:** PyTorch (GPU required)

**Required Packages:** Numpy, Pandas, random, sklearn, tqdm, csv, torch (Keras is required if you want to estimate the noise transition matrix).

## Utilities

Details of reproducing our experiment results on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Clothing 1M are mentioned in the ``README" file in each folder.
